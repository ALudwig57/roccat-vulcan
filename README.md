# Linux RGB LED effect support for the Roccat Vulcan 100/120 Keyboard

This little binary adds some bling to your Roccat Vulcan 100/120 Keyboard when you use it in Linux. It supports setting up the default "Wave" effect that the keyboard can play on its own, as well as a more advanced homegrown "Impact" effect that responds to your keystrokes, and does some "ghost" typing when you're idle.
